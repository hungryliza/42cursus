grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l to get number of physical cores 

grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l to get number of virtual cores

free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}' to get number mb of used memoir

free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}' to get number of total mb memoire

free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf("(%.2f%%)\n", $3/$2*100)}' to get pourcent of used memory

To view the occupied and available memory of the disk, we will use the df command, which stands for "disk filesystem", it is used to get a complete summary of the use of disk space. 

The used memory is shown in MB, so we will then use the -m flag.

Next, we will do a grep to only show us the lines that contain "/dev/" and then we will do another grep with the -v flag to exclude lines that contain "/boot". Finally, we will use the awk command and sum the value of the third word of each line to once all the lines are summed, print the final result of the sum. The entire command is as follows: df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{memory_use += $3} END {print memory_use}'

df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{use += $3} {total += $2} END {printf("(%d%%)\n"), use/total*100}' to get number of occuped disk memory



Random theory quaestions 

Reading from disk is several orders of magnitude slower than reading from memory, so this slows everything way down. (Exchanging data between real memory and virtual memory is "swapping". The space on disk is "swap space".)

lsblk (list block devices) is a Linux command-line utility that displays information about all available block devices (like hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, partitions, and loop devices) in a clear, tree-like format, showing their relationships, sizes, and mount points
making it essential for understanding storage configuration on a system.

difok
(different from old) is a Linux password policy setting in the pwquality.conf file that defines the minimum number of characters that must be changed (inserted, deleted, or substituted) between a user's new password and their previous one, preventing simple modifications and enforcing password strength by checking the "distance" between passwords using the Levenshtein distance algorithm

Yes, AppArmor is built into the Linux kernel
and is often pre-installed and enabled by default on many distributions like Ubuntu and Debian, acting as a mandatory access control (MAC) system to restrict program capabilities with profiles. 

encrypted LVM

When you use this option, the installer creates a few partitions: a /boot partition, which is used to store the kernel and bootloader; depending on your system, a special firmware (e.g., EFI) partition; and an encrypted partition which contains a single LVM physical volume.

Inside that encrypted LVM physical volume, there is a root partition and usually a swap partition, plus any additional partitions you want. All of these partitions are encrypted, but the /boot and /boot/efi partitions are not.

It is never possible to encrypt the EFI partition, since the firmware doesn't know how to boot it in such a state. It is possible, but uncommon, to encrypt the /boot partition; grub requires special configuration to do so, which Debian doesn't implement by default.
